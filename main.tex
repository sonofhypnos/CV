\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ArmarX Distributed Robot Framework Plugin} \hfill April 2022--September 2022 \\
          Collaborated with a team of four students to develop a C++ GUI plugin for the
          ArmarX distributed robot framework. A standout contribution of mine was the
          design and implementation of a foldable timeline that visually represented the
          robot's hierarchically structured memory over time, leveraging Qt5 for the basic components.
	\item \href{https://sonofhypnos.github.io/blog/prediction/python/2021/01/30/sp500.html}{Predicting the S\&P 500} (Python, Numpy, Pandas), by sampling from past market data. I used this to win money on the \href{https://www.almanisprivate.com/}{Almanis} prediction market. This method worked better for me than just eyeballing trends.
	\item \href{https://github.com/sonofhypnos/fatebook.el}{fatebook.el}. An Emacs plugin to create and upload predictions to Fatebook. I created the tool for my own use.
	      % \item \href{https://github.com/sonofhypnos/fatebook.el}{fatebook.el}. An Emacs plugin to create and upload predictions to Fatebook (I have no relations to Fatebook I just use their product)
