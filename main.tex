\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PIBBSS Research Hackathon: Exploring Belief State Steering in Transformer Models} \hfill June 1--3, 2024 \\
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Participated in a 2-day intensive research hackathon with two other collaborators
          \item Explored and implemented an approach using lower-dimensional belief state geometry for steering Transformer models
          \item Applied subspace steering techniques using Moore-Penrose Pseudo-Inverse
          \item Produced a brief technical report summarizing our methods and initial findings
              %#TODO: add my summary
          \item \href{https://example.com/hackathon-belief-state-steering.pdf}{Project summary}
      \end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/sonofhypnos/fatebook.el}{fatebook.el}. An Emacs plugin to create and upload predictions to Fatebook. I created the tool for my own use.
	\item \href{https://sonofhypnos.github.io/blog/prediction/python/2021/01/30/sp500.html}{Predicting the S\&P 500} Python, Numpy, Pandas, by sampling from past market data. I used this to win money on the \href{https://www.almanisprivate.com/}{Almanis} prediction market. This method worked better for me than just eyeballing trends.
  \item \textbf{ArmarX Distributed Robot Framework Plugin} \hfill April 2022--September 2022 \\
        Collaborated with a team of four students to develop a C++ GUI plugin for the
        ArmarX distributed robot framework. A standout contribution of mine was the
        design and implementation of a foldable timeline that visually represented the
        robot's hierarchically structured memory over time, leveraging Qt5 for the basic components.
